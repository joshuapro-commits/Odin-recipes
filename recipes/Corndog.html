    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A corndog is made by dipping skewered hot dogs into a thick cornbread batter made from cornmeal,</p>
        <p>flour, baking powder, eggs, milk, and a pinch of sugar, then deep-frying them until golden and crispy.</p>
        <p>The result is a savory and slightly sweet snack with a crunchy outer layer and juicy hot dog inside</p>
